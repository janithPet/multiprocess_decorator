# multiprocess_decorator
Decorators that allow functions to be run using multiprocessing

This contains some decorators that will allow a function defined under it to run in a parallel fashion by spawning multiple processes.

It is meant to remove the boilerplate code when trying to do this; as such, the use cases might be limited. 
That being said, I have tried to write the different decorators to be as general as possible. 

I will add documentation for each of the decorators as I fill this project up.
